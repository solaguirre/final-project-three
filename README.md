## Deployment

You can view our deployed project at the official [Weffle Web Page](http://www.weffle.me/). It was  deployed via Heroku at [Weffle App](https://weffle.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - The CRA boilerplate that underpins this application.  You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React
* [React Router Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - Our React Router w/DOM bindings.
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) -  Use for API calls. If I had my druthers, we would us fetch, but axios offers us way too nice a library for defaulting headers/response interceptors.
* [Use Persisted State](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-persisted-state) - A hook for a local storage state. I'm too lazy to write this.
* [Stripe for Developers](https://stripe.com/) - Checkout made simple! Integration examples from [Github](https://github.com/stripe-samples)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
